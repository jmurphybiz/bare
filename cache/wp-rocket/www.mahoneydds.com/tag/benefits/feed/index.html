				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good oral hygiene leads to stronger, healthier, and whiter teeth, which, in turn, provide benefits that go beyond oral health. Surveys and studies have documented the positive effects of having whiter teeth, most notably how it can increase confidence, improve mood and short-term happiness, and boost physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Mahoney Family Dentistry offers <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/teeth-whitening/">teeth whitening services in South Bend</a>. While there are many teeth whitening kits available, it is essential to keep your teeth healthy. Our skilled dentists can provide comprehensive dental hygiene services along with our whitening treatment.</p>
<h2>Boost Your Confidence</h2>
<p>Your teeth’s appearance may discourage you from flashing a smile or speaking in front of people because yellowed or discolored teeth may decrease your self-confidence. Researchers of a 2011 study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111029/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Annals of Ibadan Postgraduate Medicine</a> looked at 384 adolescents, a third of whom had tooth discoloration. The majority of those with stained or discolored teeth appeared to refrain from speaking, smiling, and interacting with others compared with those with healthy teeth.</p>
<p>They also appeared to have low self-esteem and other psychosocial problems. The researchers found that the psychosocial consequences of physical attractiveness affected intellectual and emotional development as well.</p>
<p>These findings also seem to reflect the results of the <a href="https://www.aacd.com/proxy/files/Publications%20and%20Resources/Whitening%20Survey_Aug12(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry</a>’s 2012 Whitening Survey, highlighting the social importance of whiter teeth. Almost all, or 99.7 percent of Americans believe that smiles are a valuable social asset, with 96 percent of respondents saying whiter teeth can attract the opposite sex. It also affects how a person appears, with 74 percent of respondents believing that an unattractive smile affects a person’s social life and career.</p>
<h2>Improve Your Mood &amp; Health</h2>
<p>Whiter teeth can make people less hesitant to smile, which can trick their brain into recreating the feeling of happiness. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/smiling-can-trick-your-brain-happiness-boost-your-health-ncna822591" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Isha Gupta</a>, a neurologist from the IGEA Brain and Spine, explains that smiling can trigger the brain to release hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which help increase the feeling of happiness. This would help people avoid feelings of aggression, sadness, and stress.</p>
<p>Being confident enough to smile can also influence your physical health. A 2012 study published by the <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/smiling-facilitates-stress-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Association for Psychological Science</a> links smiling to lower blood pressure. The researchers grouped 169 participants into three and trained each group how to hold chopsticks with their mouths in a certain way. It was done to get the groups to hold standard smiles that used the muscles around the mouth, “genuine” smiles that used eye and mouth muscles, and neutral expressions during the experiment without the researchers telling them to do so.</p>
<p>The participants were then tasked to perform stressful tasks while holding the chopsticks. During and after the tasks, the researchers recorded their heart rates and stress levels. They found that those who smiled, especially those with “genuine” smiles, had lower heart rate levels after recovering. They also found that those who smiled performed better during the tasks than those who held neutral expressions. Even if they were not happy, a smile on their face was enough to reduce their stress.</p>
<p>Whiter teeth and a healthier smile can improve your confidence, happiness, and physical health. Don’t be shy to flash a smile because of yellowed or discolored teeth.
