				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good oral hygiene leads to stronger, healthier, and whiter teeth, which, in turn, provide benefits that go beyond oral health. Surveys and studies have documented the positive effects of having whiter teeth, most notably how it can increase confidence, improve mood and short-term happiness, and boost physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Mahoney Family Dentistry offers <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/teeth-whitening/">teeth whitening services in South Bend</a>. While there are many teeth whitening kits available, it is essential to keep your teeth healthy. Our skilled dentists can provide comprehensive dental hygiene services along with our whitening treatment.</p>
<h2>Boost Your Confidence</h2>
<p>Your teeth’s appearance may discourage you from flashing a smile or speaking in front of people because yellowed or discolored teeth may decrease your self-confidence. Researchers of a 2011 study published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4111029/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Annals of Ibadan Postgraduate Medicine</a> looked at 384 adolescents, a third of whom had tooth discoloration. The majority of those with stained or discolored teeth appeared to refrain from speaking, smiling, and interacting with others compared with those with healthy teeth.</p>
<p>They also appeared to have low self-esteem and other psychosocial problems. The researchers found that the psychosocial consequences of physical attractiveness affected intellectual and emotional development as well.</p>
<p>These findings also seem to reflect the results of the <a href="https://www.aacd.com/proxy/files/Publications%20and%20Resources/Whitening%20Survey_Aug12(1).pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">American Academy of Cosmetic Dentistry</a>’s 2012 Whitening Survey, highlighting the social importance of whiter teeth. Almost all, or 99.7 percent of Americans believe that smiles are a valuable social asset, with 96 percent of respondents saying whiter teeth can attract the opposite sex. It also affects how a person appears, with 74 percent of respondents believing that an unattractive smile affects a person’s social life and career.</p>
<h2>Improve Your Mood &amp; Health</h2>
<p>Whiter teeth can make people less hesitant to smile, which can trick their brain into recreating the feeling of happiness. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/smiling-can-trick-your-brain-happiness-boost-your-health-ncna822591" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Dr. Isha Gupta</a>, a neurologist from the IGEA Brain and Spine, explains that smiling can trigger the brain to release hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, which help increase the feeling of happiness. This would help people avoid feelings of aggression, sadness, and stress.</p>
<p>Being confident enough to smile can also influence your physical health. A 2012 study published by the <a href="https://www.psychologicalscience.org/news/releases/smiling-facilitates-stress-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Association for Psychological Science</a> links smiling to lower blood pressure. The researchers grouped 169 participants into three and trained each group how to hold chopsticks with their mouths in a certain way. It was done to get the groups to hold standard smiles that used the muscles around the mouth, “genuine” smiles that used eye and mouth muscles, and neutral expressions during the experiment without the researchers telling them to do so.</p>
<p>The participants were then tasked to perform stressful tasks while holding the chopsticks. During and after the tasks, the researchers recorded their heart rates and stress levels. They found that those who smiled, especially those with “genuine” smiles, had lower heart rate levels after recovering. They also found that those who smiled performed better during the tasks than those who held neutral expressions. Even if they were not happy, a smile on their face was enough to reduce their stress.</p>
<p>Whiter teeth and a healthier smile can improve your confidence, happiness, and physical health. Don’t be shy to flash a smile because of yellowed or discolored teeth. If you feel like your teeth can be whiter, or you feel concerned about having stained teeth, visit your local dentist to schedule a teeth whitening treatment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dental implants are a stable, fixed solution for missing teeth. Plus, they feel, look, and function just like natural teeth, making them a great option for anyone looking to have permanent replacement teeth.</p>
<p>Generally, any adult with a healthy jawbone and no serious health condition can get dental <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/dentures-implants/">implants in South Bend</a>. But, the case is not the same with teenagers, whose jaws may not have reached full maturity.</p>
<h2>How Do Dental Implants Work?</h2>
<p>For this procedure to work, the patient’s jawbone has to be strong enough to hold and support the implant. After all, the first step of the process is to insert the implant into the jawbone through surgery. Then, once the jawbone heals, the oral surgeon attaches the abutment to the implant with a screw. The abutment is the part that connects the implant to the replacement tooth crown.</p>
<p>If the jawbone hasn’t completely developed like in the case of some teenagers, serious problems can arise later on. For instance, if the jawbone is still developing, the implant placed into it can become crooked over time. After all, the implant and the replacement tooth do not move with the growing jaw as real teeth do.</p>
<h2>Is There an Age Restriction for Dental Implants?</h2>
<p>Dental surgeons don’t have a fixed age rule for dental implants, as every patient is different. The upper jaw and lower jaw finish growing at different times. Some teens may be ready for implants by the age of 17 or 18, while others may have to wait for a few more years before they qualify for this procedure. Teens can undergo dental x-rays to check or monitor the growth and development of their jawbones.</p>
<p>If your teen isn’t ready yet for implant surgery but still wants to have tooth replacements, there are a few options he or she can consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removable Partial Dentures</li>
</ul>
<p>A removable partial denture can fill gaps created by missing teeth and prevent future misalignment of the remaining teeth. This dental appliance also helps preserve the jaw shape.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dental Bridges</li>
</ul>
<p>Dentures need to be removed for cleaning, so many teens prefer to have bonded bridges instead. Dental bridges are fixed in place with metal attached to the natural teeth on each side of the gap.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bone Grafting</li>
</ul>
<p>If your teen is set to have implants in the future, he or she may need a bone graft in the missing tooth socket at the time of extraction. The graft serves as a placeholder for new bone growth.</p>
<p>Dental implants provide a long-term solution for missing teeth because they are made of titanium with properties that will fuse into bone, over time. In turn, the implants become a permanent part of a patient’s smile. Then again, this procedure requires a healthy, strong, and fully-grown jawbone that your teen may not have yet.</p>
<p>If you have a teenager who has lost a tooth, whether from a sports accident, dental trauma, decay, or any another reason, don’t hesitate to bring him or her to our office. We’ll help determine the right tooth replacement option for him or her.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adult teeth are permanent compared to children’s teeth. With proper oral hygiene, your pearly whites should last a lifetime. Losing them as an adult could be alarming because they don’t grow back. Tooth loss can happen due to <a title="Medical News Today" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322028.php" rel="nofollow">gum disease, injury, or during pregnancy</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, several procedures can replace missing teeth. If you lost one or multiple teeth, it’s best to replace them immediately to prevent other serious problems. Missing teeth can <a title="Perio.org" href="https://www.perio.org/node/222" rel="nofollow">affect the appearance of your face</a>, and you’ll find it challenging to chew your food.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/dentures-implants/" rel="nofollow">dental implant services in South Bend</a>, Indiana can replace one or more of your teeth.</p>
<h2>Missing Teeth can Cause Malocclusion</h2>
<p>One of the effects of tooth loss is malocclusion or the <a title="MedlinePlus" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001058.htm">misalignment of your teeth</a>. Normally, this condition is hereditary. If the size of the upper jaw and lower jaw is different, it can lead to overcrowding of teeth or irregular bite patterns.</p>
<p>The upper and lower teeth should fit together, so you don’t bite your cheeks and lips, and your tongue stays protected.</p>
<h2>Missing Teeth can Lead to Bone Loss in the Jaw</h2>
<p>The jawbone gives structure to facial features, and it lets you speak and chew properly. That’s why it’s an essential part of your face. Losing teeth can cause <a title="DocShop.com" href="https://www.docshop.com/education/dental/conditions/bone-loss-in-jaw" rel="nofollow">bone loss in the jaw</a>, which can lead to multiple problems that affect not just your oral health but your general wellbeing, too.</p>
<p>Dental bone loss is common in people with gum disease or missing teeth. But the effect does not happen immediately, and it may take some time before you notice that your jaw bone is deteriorating. Visiting your local dentist is can help determine if you’re losing tissues in your jaw.</p>
<p>If you lose a tooth for any reason, there will be no roots to vitalize the alveolar bone, a bone section that surrounds the roots of your teeth. It’s vital that you replace your missing teeth as soon as possible because the longer you leave a tooth socket empty, the more tissues you lose.</p>
<p>These losses can affect the remaining teeth, which can result in further tooth loss, creating a vicious cycle.</p>
<h2>The Permanent Solution</h2>
<p>Dentures and bridges used to be the only options in replacing teeth. But thanks to advances in dental technology, you can have a new tooth that feels and functions like a natural one. Unlike dentures, dental implants are your <a title="WebMD" href="https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-implants#1" rel="nofollow">permanent replacement</a> for the teeth you’ve lost.</p>
<p>This treatment offers numerous benefits apart from enhancing your smile. A dental implant can improve the way you speak. It also feels more comfortable compared to dentures, and you don’t have to worry about your teeth slipping while you engage in conversations at parties.</p>
<p>Since this solution is permanent, you can enjoy your favorite meals without the feeling of discomfort and pain. Dental implants can last a lifetime as long as you take care of them properly.</p>
<p>There is a certain process when you undergo a dental implant. Before the actual procedure, our team has to determine if you’re fit to take this treatment. For qualified patients, we use cutting-edge technology to achieve the best results.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You naturally want to whiten your teeth because it will brighten your face. White teeth not only makes you attractive, but it also boosts your confidence, making you magnetic in social and professional settings. But a brighter smile is easier said than done, especially when you expose your teeth to substances that cause discoloration.</p>
<p>Our <a title="WebMD" href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/teeth-whitening/" rel="nofollow">teeth whitening services in South Bend</a> can help you regain the natural color of your teeth. We custom design whitening trays and we also have a Whitening for Life Program that helps you maintain your healthy, white teeth.</p>
<p>Beyond the treatment, we also encourage preventive maintenance and encourage you to steer clear of food and drinks that discolor your teeth.</p>
<h2>Things that Turn Your Teeth Yellow</h2>
<p>It is true that the aging process plays a big role in the <a title="WebMD" href="https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/tooth-discoloration" rel="nofollow">discoloration of your teeth</a>. But other factors contribute to turning your teeth into a yellowish color. These factors can be the food and drinks you consume or the lifestyle you have.</p>
<p>Drinks like tea, coffee, sodas, and wines can stain your teeth. Certain fruits and vegetable (apples and potatoes) also have a similar effect. So do cigarettes or tobacco, which can turn your teeth darker. If you smoke, it&#8217;s critical to pay attention to your dental hygiene. Proper brushing, rinsing, and flossing can help to remove stain-producing substances, from coffee to cigarettes.</p>
<p>People with certain diseases are also prone to teeth discoloration because of the treatments. For example, chemotherapy and head and neck radiation can change the color of the teeth.</p>
<h2>Preventing Teeth Discoloration</h2>
<p>You can <a title="Medical News Today" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321172.php" rel="nofollow">prevent your teeth from turning yellow</a> by eating the right food, choosing what you drink, and practicing oral hygiene. But if you must consume stain-producing food and drinks, make sure to rinse your mouth with water after eating or drinking.</p>
<p>You should brush your teeth for at least two times a day and two to three minutes at a time. Make sure you’re brushing every surface of your teeth especially those at the back of your mouth.</p>
<p>When you’re brushing your teeth, you can use whitening toothpaste. It can reduce the yellow color on your teeth and enhance the whiteness. Whitening toothpaste has stronger ingredients compared to regular ones that help remove tough food stains.</p>
<p>You can also try whitening strips. These products contain a thin layer of peroxide gel on strips made of plastic, and its shape fits onto the teeth.</p>
<p>Preventive maintenance and at-home treatments can help you retain the appearance of your teeth. The best way to keep or restore a brighter smile is to arrange an appointment for chairside treatment.</p>
<h2>Let the Professionals Help You</h2>
<p>Your dentist can perform teeth whitening procedure to avoid darkening or yellowing of your teeth. We believe the best way to achieve a brighter smile is to get refillable custom trays, which give you the freedom to touch-ups.</p>
<p>Here at Mahoney Family Dentistry, we believe that professionally done teeth whitening procedure can provide you with the results you seek. With our commitment to a standard of excellence in personalized conservative dental care, we give you a safe treatment that will meet your goal.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People sport different shades of teeth color, but what color should they ideally be?</p>
<p>Teeth color is affected by multiple factors: age, calcium content, diet, lifestyle, and more. It is the result of one or more of these factors and can even be a sign of decay or other medical conditions plaguing the teeth.</p>
<p>Ideally, most teeth should be light gray or white for them to be healthy. Otherwise, <a title="Medical Xpress" href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-03-discolored-teeth.html" rel="nofollow">teeth that sport different colors</a> may be a tell-tale sign of unhealthy diets, lifestyles that require change, or dental procedures. While dentists use a scale that shows the different possible shades of teeth, the basic teeth shades manifest what could be wrong with your teeth.</p>
<h2>Black Teeth</h2>
<p>Having black teeth can be a sign of two things: extrinsic staining or internal disease that is destroying the enamel. Either way, the teeth don’t turn black altogether. It happens gradually, so you should address the problems as soon as you notice the first signs of blackening.</p>
<p>Chewing or smoking tobacco and consuming dark food and drink such as coffee and red wine can cause staining. People who are in this habit will see their teeth turn a light shade of black eventually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an <a title="Medical News Today" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321777.php" rel="nofollow">internal disease can destroy the enamel</a> through cavities or tooth decay. In this case, the black is actually dead tissue that has gone bad and is working its way to the external part of the tooth. It should start to appear as spots before it ultimately covers the whole tooth.</p>
<h2>Yellow Teeth</h2>
<p>Yellow teeth can be a sign of multiple things: poor dental hygiene, an acidic diet, or old age. When people consume food but do not practice dental hygiene, plaque or tartar can begin to build up in the teeth, causing them to turn yellow.</p>
<p>Age and acidic food work similarly to turn teeth yellow. Underneath the enamel, <a title="MedicineNet" href="https://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=43091)" rel="nofollow">the dentin is naturally a yellow color</a>. This becomes visible once the enamel wears away. Acidic food wears out the enamel over time, allowing the yellow color to surface.</p>
<h2>Grayish-White to White</h2>
<p>Ideally, teeth should be a grayish-white to a white color. The gray or white color comes from the calcium in the enamel. People who practice proper dental hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet can see healthy-looking teeth.</p>
<p>People with stained teeth can also strive for whiter teeth by doing the same. However, for some, this may be difficult to do on their own. While different methods and products guarantee white teeth, the safe and effective solution is for you to go to your local dentist and schedule a teeth whitening treatment.</p>
<p>During a teeth whitening treatment, you have to undergo multiple procedures over an interval of time before you can see whiter teeth. Whitening treatments that don’t promise immediate drastic results are often the ones that don’t cause damage to the surface of your teeth.</p>
<p>For the duration of the treatment/s, you must avoid food, drinks, and tobacco that can stain your teeth. You must also develop good dental hygiene habits.</p>
<p>While colored teeth may have natural causes and aren’t always a cause for worry, having white teeth improves your confidence and boasts a healthy diet and lifestyle. Mahoney Family Dentistry recommends leaving teeth whitening to the professionals to avoid risks. We provide <a title="Mahoney Family Dentistry" href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/teeth-whitening/">teeth whitening services to South Bend, Indiana</a> residents and other dental procedures that can help improve your smiles.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dental implants have remained one of the best (if not the best) long-term options for tooth replacement. Unlike dentures, which are removable, difficult to maintain, and have to be refitted to fit the jaw,<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-cohen/5-things-you-should-know-_13_b_11259686.html"> dental implants</a> are artificial teeth permanently secured in one’s mouth. It prevents teeth from shifting and other dental problems from arising.</p>
<p>However, while tooth implants are a good solution, it is best to avoid any further complications that could lead to other dental conditions in the rest of the teeth, gums, and jaw. To avoid this, one must be aware of the early signs suggesting the need for implants. Here’s what you should look out for.</p>
<p>Once you see signs that it’s time for implants, we encourage you to schedule an appointment with Mahoney Family Dentistry. We provide<a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/dentures-implants"> dental implants in South Bend, Indiana</a> and can help you determine if implants are the right procedure for you.</p>
<h2>Severe Tooth Pain &amp; Tooth Decay</h2>
<p>Dental pain can be a sign of irreparable decay, especially after a root canal procedure, says<a href="https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/11/16/indications-you-may-need-a-dental-implant"> US News Health</a>. When tooth decay is considered non-restorable, the tooth will have to be removed, leaving a gap in the mouth that could result in more dental problems.</p>
<p>Look out for pain that was unprovoked by eating or drinking; that could be a sign of tooth decay. You may also find your gums swelling around the area the pain occurred.</p>
<h2>Tooth Gaps</h2>
<p>When a tooth is missing, or there is a significant gap between two teeth, this could lead to more pain, dental problems, and even the loss of confidence to smile. When space in your mouth is left untreated, the teeth adjacent and the tooth above or below it will begin to shift: the adjacent teeth will move toward the space, while the tooth above or below will grow further until it reaches the gums, causing more discomfort.</p>
<p>Missing teeth can also affect the jaw. With the root missing, that area of the jaw is no longer stimulated, and the force of chewing is placed on the adjacent teeth. This causes the jawbone to shrink, an effect which is difficult to repair even with bone grafting techniques.</p>
<p>If you have missing teeth, removable dentures have always been an option. However, dentures are only temporary and provide no support on the roots. Because of the shrinking jawline, you will need constant refitting to make your dentures fit. It will also make it difficult to speak, chew, and smile.</p>
<h2>Cavities and Gum Diseases</h2>
<p>Dental diseases such as cavities, tooth decay, and periodontitis or gum disease can be the source of irreparable damage to teeth; as a result, one or more teeth will have to be taken out. Otherwise, to leave it there or delay removal can have lasting effects on the rest of your teeth.</p>
<p>Early signs of these diseases do not necessarily mean it’s time for implants – it can still be possible for dental practitioners to control the situation. But if these diseases become too severe to restore teeth, dentists will have to take it out and consider implants to replace the removed tooth.</p>
<p>By detecting these signs as early as possible, patients save themselves from possible pain and deterioration of their teeth and gums. Having implants installed earlier will also increase the chances of a successful implant with fewer risks of teeth shift or other dental problems that could arise from possible complications.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tooth loss affects a person’s life <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9489217">in more ways than one</a>. Our teeth — together with our tongue, cheeks, and facial muscles — play an important role in producing variations of sound, intonation, and inflection when we speak. Certain enunciations are only possible when the apex of the tongue interacts with the lower and upper anterior teeth.</p>
<p>The restorative treatments and dental appliances we offer in South Bend Indiana like <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/dentures-implants/">dental implants</a>, crowns, and bridges are, therefore, not only for cosmetic purposes. They also preserve your ability to communicate well.</p>
<h2>Teeth&#8217;s Role in Phonetics</h2>
<p>Hold a mirror close to your face and speak. Pay close attention to how your jaw and tongue move. You’ll notice that with some pronunciations, your tongue presses directly to your teeth. Notice, too, that the positioning of your tongue, lips, and teeth sends air in various directions and gusts.</p>
<h3>TH Sounds</h3>
<p><em>Three, thanks, Math</em> – The tongue is relaxed, and the edge lightly touches the entire upper teeth.</p>
<p><em>That, these, those </em>– The tongue contracts and the tip goes under and a little past the two front teeth. The lips pucker more than they do with <em>three, thanks, </em>and <em>Math.</em></p>
<h3>F and V Sounds</h3>
<p><em>Fan, wolf, flavor, savor, vase</em> – The entire upper teeth press onto the puckered lower lip. The air passes through the gaps of the upper front teeth, creating an audible difference between <em>f </em>and <em>v.</em></p>
<h3>S and Z Sounds</h3>
<p><em>Summer, sunshine, maze, crazy –</em> The upper and lower teeth meet, trapping air in the oral cavity. The tongue’s movement creates the nuances between the <em>s </em>and <em>z.</em></p>
<h3>J and Zh Sounds</h3>
<p><em>Judge, major, treasure, explosion</em> – The upper and lower teeth also meet, although the lower jaw pulls back more than with the <em>s </em>and <em>z </em>sounds.</p>
<h3>M Sound</h3>
<p><em>Some, cream, master</em> – The upper and lower lip meet and curve over the teeth upper and lower teeth, respectively. This position creates a round cavern in the mouth, and the vibrations from your voice create the suppressed <em>m </em>sound.</p>
<h3>N Sound</h3>
<p><em>Nice, never, insane</em> – The flat of the tongue touches the roof of the mouth while the tip presses against the back of the upper front teeth.</p>
<p>These words — indeed, the phonetics — would be difficult to produce without teeth. Observe how <a href="https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/data-statistics/tooth-loss/seniors">old people who have lost several teeth</a> speak. Their voices still carry through, but the accuracy of their pronunciations varies. People they talk to have a harder time understanding them as a result.</p>
<h2>The Permanent Solution to Tooth Loss and Speech Difficulties</h2>
<p>Edentulous people are fortunate that modern dentistry offers them long-term solutions. Dental crowns and bridges are faster and more affordable than dental implants, but the latter provides permanence. Mahoney Family Dentistry can also administer single-tooth and multiple tooth replacements through dental implantation.</p>
<p>The effect of tooth loss on one’s speech is palpable and audible. It affects our confidence and effectiveness in expressing our opinions. If your looks don’t bother you, then the possibility of not being able to speak properly and be understood should.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let missing teeth affect how you speak. Care for your teeth with a healthful diet, good oral hygiene, and timely dental check-ups. Fulfill the latter with Mahoney Family Dentistry. <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/contact-us/">Contact us </a>today.</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At what age should parents take their children to the dentist for the first time? This is a question our team at Mahoney Family Dentistry encounters frequently. And, in our experience, the question might come too late as some parents put off bringing their children to the dentist because they think it might frighten them or that they’re too young to experience painful procedures.</p>
<p>Allow us to correct these assumptions. First, children become scared of dentists when they sense that their parents fear them too. They look to you, their parents, for clues on how to respond to unfamiliar things. Second, not all dental procedures are painful. In fact, the earlier you bring your kids to the dentist, the less likely that they will have to undergo serious corrective treatments.</p>
<h2>As Early as One Year Old</h2>
<p>The American Dental Association says parents may begin consulting a dentist within the first six months <a title="KidsHealth" href="https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/healthy.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">following the appearance of the first tooth</a>. Children should have their first dental visit by their first birthday, at the very least.</p>
<p>At Mahoney Family Dentistry, our <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/pediatric-dentistry/">South Bend pediatric dentists</a> evaluate your child’s gum and tooth health on his or her first visit. We’ll advise you on the types of toothbrush and toothpaste to use, as well as the proper brushing techniques for young gums and teeth. Our dentists work well with children, and they do their best to make sure each child’s first dentist visit is a happy experience.</p>
<h2>Developing a Positive Perception of Dental Care</h2>
<p>When a child’s first dental appointment is a happy experience, he or she is less likely to fear coming back. An unpleasant first experience, on the other hand, can fuel a child’s fear. He or she might associate dentists with pain and discomfort; they could take this fear all through adolescence and adulthood.</p>
<p>Taking your child to the dentist at an early age helps ensure their positive perception in two ways. First, since they’ll be less likely to have teeth and gum problems, they won’t have to associate dentist visits with pain. Second, they become used to interacting with clinic staff and sitting in the dentist’s chair. They won’t feel intimidated because they’re already familiar with the clinic’s environment.</p>
<p>It’s also important not to show your fear or reluctance to go to the dentist. Children are empathetic; they’re quick to mirror the emotions of the people around them, especially their parents’. Be an example they can follow.</p>
<h2>Baby Tooth Decay May Have Lifelong Results</h2>
<p>It’s not just the first visit that’s important in ensuring your child forms a good relationship with their dental health care provider; the subsequent ones are just as important. If you wait years before bringing your child to the dentist for the second time, you’re putting your child’s oral health at risk.</p>
<p>Toddlers are prone to dental problems with lasting effects. An example is <a title="American Dental Association" href="https://www.ada.org/en/about-the-ada/ada-positions-policies-and-statements/statement-on-early-childhood-caries" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Early Childhood Carries or ECC</a>. It is an infectious disease that causes the primary teeth to decay. It affects six year old children and younger with poor oral hygiene habits. Severe ECC could result in tooth loss and nerve damage and compromise the growth of permanent teeth (which lie partially-developed beneath the primary teeth). So, make sure you bring your child along to the dentist not only at the first sign of a baby tooth, but also do regular follow up visits.</p>
<p>An early first visit to the dentist can preempt ECC and other dental issues. Mahoney Family Dentistry can give you more pointers on this matter. <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/contact-us">Contact us</a> to schedule an appointment for your child.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may not notice it, but your teeth can give away your age or, sometimes, make you even look older. That doesn’t sound too bad. But, in moments you meet a person for the first time, such as romantic dates or job interviews, you might want your smile to put you in your best light.</p>
<p>If you want to look younger and healthier, taking better care of your teeth is a great way to start. Brush your teeth thrice a day, floss daily, and see your dentist for routine cleanings. But sometimes, even the best preventive measures can’t stop the natural aging process of your teeth. That’s where our dentist comes in.</p>
<h2>Whiten Your Teeth</h2>
<p>Teeth naturally darken as we age for two main reasons. One, our teeth get stained as they absorb color from the food we eat and beverages we drink. We can prevent this by brushing after every meal and drink. Two, our teeth yellow over time regardless of the color they absorb from our food and drink. But with regular teeth whitening sessions, you can keep your teeth bright and white.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea with teeth whitening is repetition. Our treatment for <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/procedures/teeth-whitening/">teeth whitening in South Bend, Indiana</a>, for instance, involves the use of a custom tray that you can refill every time you need a whitening touch-up. Plus, with custom trays, you can achieve a deep and thorough color change.</p>
<h2>Replace Metal Fillings</h2>
<p>Dentists apply dental fillings to restore teeth damaged by decay. They remove the corrosion from the affected teeth and fill them with amalgam filling or composite resin to rebuild their size, shape, and function. Previously, dentists <em>only</em> used amalgam filling — a metal alloy mixture — for this procedure.  So, if you have silver metal fillings in your teeth, it’s a definite giveaway of your age. Let our dentist replace those fillings with composite, tooth-colored resin.</p>
<h2>Consider Veneers</h2>
<p>Getting dental veneers is a great way to turn back the clock. Veneers are thin pieces of porcelain or composite resin skin that dentists bond to your tooth to correct its shape, size, and color. Our dentists often recommend veneers when your anterior teeth are chipped, discolored, or worn. If you have a small gap between your two front teeth, veneers are ideal, as well.</p>
<p>Porcelain veneers can be costly, but these often last 10 to 20 years. If you want a less expensive option, consider composite resin veneers, which can last for four to eight years.</p>
<h2>Get Implants</h2>
<p>Losing teeth has always been associated with age. So, if you’re missing one or two front teeth, chances are you look much older than your real age. Our dentists recommend dental implants to replace your missing teeth permanently. Implants are tiny metal devices that act as tooth roots once surgically implanted on your jaw. They hold natural-looking, custom-made replacement teeth that can totally transform your smile.</p>
<p>Want to know how you can get a young-looking smile? We’re here to help. Our dentists are available for consultations and service appointments. <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/contact-us/">Give us a call</a> today.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dentures are an excellent alternative for individuals with missing teeth. They help give people a beautiful smile and make it easier for them to eat and talk. While dentures serve as a substitute for real teeth, however, this does not mean that you can sleep in them.  You must, in fact, take your dentures off and put them in a glass of water before retiring for the day. If you insist on sleeping with your dentures on, you risk facing the following consequences.</p>
<h2>Sore Gums</h2>
<p>Your gums are vital for wearing dentures. They are primarily responsible for keeping your dentures in the proper position. If you fail to remove your dentures before going to sleep, your gums will likely become swollen and red due to the constant pressure applied by the dentures. Removing your dentures each night, along with brushing each morning, will keep your gums healthy.</p>
<h2>Higher Risk of Getting Pneumonia</h2>
<p>A few studies have reported that the risk of developing pneumonia goes up significantly if you sleep with your dentures. One reason is that leaving your dentures overnight creates an ideal breeding ground for bacteria, which can travel to your lungs and result in the contraction of pneumonia.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the act of swallowing saliva is harder when you wear dentures. Thus, you are more likely to drive moisture into your lungs, which could result in pneumonia or other respiratory infections. So, make it a habit of taking off your dentures at night to prevent bacteria from going into your lungs.</p>
<h2>Greater Likelihood of Developing Denture-Related Stomatitis</h2>
<p>Stomatitis is a general term for a sore and inflamed mouth. This condition can disrupt your ability to sleep, talk, and eat. If you develop denture-related stomatitis, it would be mainly due to an infected palate. You will find that the roof of your mouth becomes inflamed and red due to excessive exposure to oral bacteria. To avoid contracting denture-related stomatitis, remove your dentures. This way, you prevent infecting the tissues beneath them as well.</p>
<h2>Acceleration of Resorption and Bone Loss</h2>
<p>Resorption happens when the bones beneath the gums become more brittle and thinner because of the constant pressure of wearing dentures. It could reshape your jaw and eventually cause your false teeth to fall off easily, as the dentures no longer fit appropriately inside your mouth. Moreover, since resorption affects the bone structure of your face, you may experience unwanted changes in your facial appearance and expressions.</p>
<h2>Faster Deterioration of Dentures</h2>
<p>Oral bacteria can accumulate inside your dentures and cause them to weaken and fall apart. Sleeping with your dentures on accelerates this process by allowing more bacteria to do the damage. Remove your dentures before sleeping and make sure they are clean if you want to prolong their life.</p>
<p>Removing your dentures at night prevents sore gums and resorption, minimizes the risk of developing pneumonia and denture-related stomatitis, and helps extend the life of your oral appliance. If you need <a href="http://www.mahoneydds.com/dentures-partials/">partial or complete dentures in South Bend, Indiana</a>, turn to Mahoney Family Dentistry. The dentures we offer blend naturally with your remaining teeth or as close as possible with your missing teeth. We also provide instructions on taking care of your new dental appliance.</p>
