== Description ==

>WordPress Leads works as a standalone plugin or hand in hand with [WordPress Landing Pages](http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/ "Learn more about WordPress Landing Pages") & [WordPress Calls to Action](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cta/ "Learn more about Calls to Action") to create a powerful & free lead generation system for your business.

Wordpress Leads assists with capturing and segmenting user activity into lead profiles. Leads plugin ships with it's own form collection tool but can be extended to use [Ninja Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninja-forms/), [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/), or [Contact Form 7](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/). This plugin connects directly with the [Landing Pages](http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/ ) and [Calls to Action](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cta/) plugin provided by [Inbound Now](https://www.inboundnow.com).

= Gather Valuable Intelligence on your Leads: =

* View the page view funnel leading up to a submission
* See past comments they have made on your blog
* Know what they have searched for on your site

* See social media profiles and sites they own (Provided by [Full Contact](https://www.fullcontact.com/))

This powerful lead data can help you sell smarter and more efficiently.

Wordpress Leads was originally built as an add-on for [WordPress Landing Pages](http://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/ "Learn more about WordPress Landing Pages") but quickly grew into its own stand alone plugin to capture lead information on any page of your site.

Manage your leads directly from the admin interface, or send the lead data into a third party CRM of your choosing.

This plugin is built to be fully extendable by providing custom action and filter hooks, allowing for an almost endless number of powerful CRM application addons.
